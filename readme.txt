Business Directory Service provides an API where Publishers can connect and request data. Such a service is provided through the BD for Wordpress Plugin.

== Description ==
The Business Directory (BD) is a service that allows the central management of business listings. It provides a mechanism to collect and store businesses data and then make them available to Publishers (websites).
A Publisher can open an account with Business Directory and opt to receive catalog data from BD database. The Publisher has the option to define specific query parameters that make the data that he receives to be more relevant to what he needs.
Publishers can make requests currently based on Business Listing (BL) categories and Registered Cities.
A Business Listing is actually a record of a company or professional. A company or a professional can register with BD and add his company\'s details (address, contact, photos, etc). A BL does this because they want to expose these information to various Publishers. The advantage that BD provides is that BLs can add their data in one central Database (the BD) and then opt to which Publishers his data can become available. This helps from avoiding to add the  same data multiple times with many different catalogs and keeping them updated.
